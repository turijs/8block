# 8-block puzzle (built in 2015)
## Description
This is my implementation of the classic 8-block puzzle. I included an auto-solve feature that makes use of a best-first search algorithm. It is also possible to solve puzzles manually.
## How to play
The goal is to get all the blocks in order from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, starting with the "1" block in the top left corner and finishing with empty space in the bottom right corner (not pictured). You can move blocks by sliding them into the empty space; only blocks adjacent to the space may be moved. Move a block by clicking or tapping on it.
